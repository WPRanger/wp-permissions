WordPress Upload Permissions
============================

### Display file permissions of a WordPress uploads directory tree.

This simple little plugin examines a WordPress uploads directory and displays all the directory
permissions in octal notation. 

I put it together with the intention of helping lost souls in the wordpress.org forums who are struggling
to upload media due to incorrect file permissions. 

#### Install

Upload the plugin to your plugins directory, activate it and view it in action in your Dashboard Tools menu.

Wonder at its astonishing beauty.
