WordPress Upload Permissions
============================

### Display file permissions of a WordPress uploads directory tree.

This simple little plugin examines a WordPress uploads directory and displays all the file and directory
permissions in octal notation.  It's not pretty, but it does its job!

I put it together with the intention of helping lost souls in the wordpress.org forums who are strugling
to upload media due to incorrect file permissions. 

#### Install

Upload the plugin to your plugins directory, activate it and view it in action in your Dashboard Tools menu.

Wonder at its astonishing beauty.

#### Credit 
The main function is taken from [Here](http://deadlytechnology.com/scripts/displaying-file-permissions-with-php/) which is (gulp) 7 years old!  I may write my own function and prettify it.  Or maybe not.
